                <p class ="sad">Poor me, pour me another drink
                    'Cause I don't wanna feel a thing</p>
                <p class ="frustration">No more, hell nah</p>
                <p class ="sad">I just wanna sip 'til the pain wears off
                    Poor me, pour me another round
                    Line 'em up and knock 'em down  
                    Two more let's go
                    'Cause I ain't never hurt like this before
                    Don't wanna think about her
                    Or wear a ring without her
                    Don't wanna hit the karaoke bar
                    Can't sing without her
                    So make them drinks strong
                    'Cause brother she's gone
                    And if I'm ever gonna move on
                    I'ma need some whiskey glasses
                    'Cause I don't wanna see the truth</p>

                <p class ="jealousy">She's probably making out on the couch right now  
                    With someone new</p>
                <p class ="Intense">Yeah, I'ma need some whiskey glasses
                    If I'm gonna make it through
                    If I'ma be single
                    I'ma need a double shot of that heartbreak proof
                    And see the world through whiskey glasses
                    (Ain't nothing else to do, but sip around the truth)
                    And see the world through whiskey glasses
                    (I need a better view, where I don't drink to you)</p>

                <p class="sad">Last call
                    I swear this will be my last call
                    Now I ain't drunk dialling no more at 3 am
                    "Mr bartender hittin' me again"
                    Don't wanna think about her
                    Or wear a ring without her
                    Don't wanna hit the karaoke bar
                    Can't sing without her
                    So make them drinks strong
